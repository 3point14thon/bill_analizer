"|I|116th CONGRESS|1st Session|H. R. 5466|IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES|A BILL|"To provide relief for victims of hate crimes, advance the safety and well-being of immigrants and
			 refugees, and fund improved law enforcement and prosecution official
			 training."|" 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the  Prevention of Anti-Immigrant Violence Act of 2019 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Anti-immigrant violence is on the rise, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reporting an 11.8-percent increase in hate crimes against individuals for 2018 compared to 2017 and an observed shift in crimes against individuals as opposed to property. The FBI data shows that 59.6 percent of hate crimes reported were motivated by race, ethnicity, or ancestry. In addition, the 24 hate crime murders recorded in 2018 are the highest ever reported by the FBI since it began tracking hate crimes in 1991. Since 2014, FBI hate crime statistics have shown an increasing trend in hate crimes, with the highest yearly gains so far reported for 2017 at 17 percent. (2) The vast majority of the reported hate crimes are related to race, ethnicity, or ancestry. According to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Hispanics experience close to double the rate of hate crime victimization that non-Hispanic Whites (1.3 vs 0.7 per 1,000). The 2019 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data shows that non-US citizens are victimized at a rate of approximately 12.5 victims per 1,000 non-US citizens. (3) BJS has shown a precipitous decline in reporting of hate crimes since 2014, with BJS’s NCVS data showing that between 2013 and 2017 more than half of all hate crimes (>100,000) went unreported annually. NCVS 2019 statistics show that after declining by more than 60 percent in the past 21 years, the number of violent crime victims has steadily increased since 2015; and that the rate of unreported violent crimes continues to rise; increasing from 9.5 to 12.9 per 1,000 persons between 2015 and 2018. (4) Many immigrant advocates cite fear of deportation as one of the reasons people are not coming forward to report crimes. The threat of being reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is used by perpetrators of hate crimes to silence both victims and witnesses and to avoid criminal prosecution. (5) Detention and removal of victims of hate crimes undermine the rule of law and gives perpetrators the means by which to escape prosecution. The deportation of victims and witnesses denies them the ability to see justice served, prevents law enforcement from keeping communities safe, and exacerbates the problems communities face in the rise of anti-immigrant violence. (6) Lack of resources has prevented law enforcement, prosecutors, and victimized communities from learning about available tools for their protection and the prosecution of these crimes. Everyone seeking justice for victims and eager to see a reduction in hate crimes must be afforded the resources to learn and educate the public of these available tools. 3. Expansion of criminal activity for which a U visa may be issued; additional U visas made available (a) Expansion of criminal activity Section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U) fraud in foreign labor contracting (as defined in section 1351 of title 18, United States Code); hate crime acts; (b) Additional visas made available Section 214(p)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1184(p)(2)(A) 10,000 12,000 4. Prohibition of removal of non-citizens with pending petitions and applications (a) In general A non-citizen described in subsection (b) shall not be removed from the United States under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1229a (b) Non-Citizens described A non-citizen is described in this subsection if the non-citizen— (1) has a pending application under section 101(a)(15)(T), 101(a)(15)(U), 101(a)(27)(J), 106, 240A(b)(2), or 244(a)(3) (as in effect on March 31, 1997) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101 (2) is a VAWA self-petitioner, as defined in section 101(a)(51) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, with a pending application for relief. 5. Prohibition on detention of certain victims with pending petitions and applications Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1226 
				 (a) Prohibition on detention of certain victims with pending petitions and applications (1) In general Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there shall be a presumption that the non-citizen described in paragraph (2) should be released from detention. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the duty of rebutting this presumption, which may only be shown based on clear and convincing evidence, including credible and individualized information, that the use of alternatives to detention will not reasonably ensure the appearance of the non-citizen at removal proceedings, or that the non-citizen is a threat to another person or the community. The fact that a non-citizen has a criminal charge pending against the non-citizen may not be the sole factor to justify the continued detention of the non-citizen. (2) Non-citizen described A non-citizen is described in this paragraph if the non-citizen— (A) has a pending application under section 101(a)(15)(T), 101(a)(15)(U), 101(a)(27)(J), 106, 240A(b)(2), or 244(a)(3) (as in effect on March 31, 1997); or (B) is a VAWA self-petitioner, as defined in section 101(a)(51), with a pending application for relief. . 6.

			 for other purposes."|" 1. Short title and table of contents (a) Short title This Act may be cited as the  American Public Lands and Waters Climate Solution Act of 2019 (b) Table of contents The table of contents for this Act is the following: 
					 Sec. 1. Short title and table of contents. Sec. 2. Public lands energy and climate policy. Sec. 3. Public lands greenhouse gas reduction targets and requirements. Sec. 4. Online publication of greenhouse gas emissions. Sec. 5. Public lands greenhouse gas reduction strategic plan. Sec. 6. Revenues for transition assistance. Sec. 7. Economic revitalization for fossil fuel dependent communities. Sec. 8. Office of Climate Change Mitigation and Planning. Sec. 9. Definitions. 2. Public lands energy and climate policy It is the policy of the United States that— (1) the United States should aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from United States public lands and oceans and strive to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible; (2) public lands should be managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollutant emissions and to respond to unavoidable impacts of climate change through increased resilience of ecosystems and wildlife habitats in accordance with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield; (3) the protection of ocean ecosystems is vital to promoting ocean health and increasing resilience to climate change, and conservation of United States marine resources is one of the best ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; (4) energy development decisions on public lands and oceans should be guided by the goals of— (A) protecting human well-being, biodiversity, and the environment; (B) avoiding the most harmful impacts of climate change; and (C) promoting a rapid, sustainable, just, and equitable transition to a clean energy economy; and (5) environmental justice communities are more vulnerable to the effects of emissions from public lands and oceans and often have the least resources to respond; thus, they should be meaningfully engaged in government decision making as our Nation reduces emissions from public lands and oceans and builds its climate resilience against the effects of those emissions. 3. Public lands greenhouse gas reduction targets and requirements (a) Fossil fuel leasing pause Notwithstanding other mineral leasing laws, the Secretary shall not hold new lease sales for coal, oil, or gas for one year after enactment of this Act, and until the Secretary— (1) certifies, in accordance with all applicable laws, that additional fossil fuel leasing on public lands is not inconsistent with achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from public lands by 2040; and (2) releases the first Public Lands Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategic Plan as required under section 5. (b) Emission reduction targets The Secretary and the Chief shall reduce net emissions associated with the extraction and end-use combustion of fossil fuels produced from public lands in the United States to meet the following targets: (1) A reduction of net emissions of not less than 35 percent of the baseline identified in subsection (c) by January 1, 2025. (2) A reduction of net emissions of not less than 60 percent of the baseline identified in subsection (c) by January 1, 2030.

(f) Enforcement (1) No new fossil fuel permits or lease sales If the Director of the United States Geological Survey determines that net emissions from public lands have exceeded the targets in the Strategy, the Secretary shall not approve new fossil fuel permits and shall not hold new fossil fuel lease sales until a certification and public notice by such Director that net emissions are below the target level for the most recent calendar year. (2) Certification The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources in the House of Representatives a certification within 30 days of each statutory deadline for the required emission reductions. Notice of the certification shall be published in the Federal Register on or before the date the certification is due to Congress. (3) Judicial enforcement Any interested party can seek judicial review in Federal district court for failure to complete the required certification by the statutory deadline. (g) Environmental justice communities (1) In general When taking any action to meet the emission reduction targets established in subsection (b), the Secretary and the Chief shall— (A) prioritize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollutants that will affect an environmental justice community; and (B) ensure that such action does not result in a net increase of co-pollutant emissions or otherwise have a disparate impact on an environmental justice community. (2) Identification of environmental justice communities The Secretary, in consultation with other relevant agencies, shall establish by regulation criteria for identifying environmental justice communities for the purposes of paragraph (1). 4. Online publication of greenhouse gas emissions (a) In general The Secretary shall make freely available on a public website, with respect to the previous year— (1) information that describes for each fossil fuel operation that is subject to the mineral leasing laws or title III or V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ( 30 U.S.C. 1761 (A) the aggregate amount of each fossil fuel, by type and by State, produced on Federal leases; and (B) for gas reported, the portion and source of such amount that was released or disposed of by each of venting, flaring, and fugitive release; and (2) information that describes the amount and sources of energy, in delivered megawatt hours, produced from operating solar, wind, and geothermal projects on public lands under lease for the production of renewable energy.

"|I|116th CONGRESS|1st Session|H. R. 5448|IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES|A BILL|"To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to assess the unintended
			 impacts on the health and safety of people engaged in transactional sex,
			 in connection with the enactment of the Allow States and Victims to Fight
			 Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 ("|" 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the  SESTA/FOSTA Examination of Secondary Effects for Sex Workers Study Act SAFE SEX Workers Study Act 2. Findings The Congress finds the following: (1) People who engage in consensual, transactional sex utilize online platforms to protect their health, safety, and independence. This use includes building community connections, distribution of harm reduction information and techniques, identification and screening of potential clients, and negotiating the terms of consensual, transactional sex services, including condom use and other harm reduction strategies. (2) Widespread discrimination against populations, including LGBTQI+ individuals, particularly transgender women of color, prevents many from accessing formal employment resources and educational opportunities. (3) In the 2015 United States Transgender Survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 19 percent of respondents reported having exchanged sex for resources, such as for money, food, or a place to sleep. Transgender women of color, including Black (42 percent), American Indian (28 percent), multiracial (27 percent), Latina (23 percent), and Asian (22 percent) respondents were more likely to have participated in sex work than the overall sample. (4) In the 2015 United States Transgender Survey, respondents who experienced homelessness in the past year (17 percent) were more than three times as likely to have participated in sex work during that year compared to the overall sample. (5) On a broader scale, internet platforms foster connections between people and play an integral part in American society. Meaningful regulation of internet platforms must take into account the role they play in the health, safety, and privacy of all people’s lives. (6) While policymakers, representatives of internet platforms, and some advocates have discussed ways to mitigate the use of internet platforms to decrease exploitation, people who consensually trade sex are rarely involved in the drafting of legislation or policies, or in assessing their impact, despite being amongst the populations who are impacted by legislation and policies related to the regulation of these internet platforms. (7) On February 27, 2018, the House of Representatives passed the Allow States to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as SESTA/FOSTA. While SESTA/FOSTA holds websites liable for user-generated content that facilitates sex trafficking, it also impacts online platforms where users discuss consensual sex work and related topics. (8) Contemporaneously with the passage of SESTA/FOSTA in the Senate on March 21, 2018, websites preemptively shut down, some directly citing the law’s passage as the rationale for closure. (9) One week before President Donald Trump signed SESTA/FOSTA into law ( Public Law 115–164 (10) While these websites and individual accounts have been closing down, there has been no national investigation rigorously examining the impact of losing access to these platforms on the health and safety of people in consensual, transactional sex work. Regional and anecdotal information from health and safety service providers and sex workers has pointed to significant impacts on the health and safety of people who engage in consensual, transactional sex. (11) Community organizations have reported increased homelessness of sex workers, including of sex workers who are caretakers for their families and have lost the economic stability provided by access to online platforms. (12) Sex workers have reported a reduced ability to screen potential clients for safety, and negotiate for boundaries such as condom use, resulting in reports of physical and sexual violence. (13) Many sex workers have turned to street-based work, which has historically involved higher rates of violence than other forms of transactional sex. Street-based sex workers have frequently noted practices which harm their health and safety, such as the confiscation of condoms by police, or use of condoms as evidence of arrest for prostitution. (14) With this new level of precarity, isolation, and vulnerability, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that members of the sex work community are more frequently being contacted by third parties seeking to engage in management activities. This includes both sex workers who had always worked independently, as well as those who have previously experienced violence and exploitation by a third party. (15) The United States Government has long discussed the importance of assessing collateral consequences when looking at other industries. A comprehensive study is essential to evaluate the impact on the health and safety of those involved in consensual, transactional sex, who are increasingly losing access to digital platforms, which have been used for harm reduction information and techniques, and to screen clients. Informed government policies begin with seeking out relevant information to better guide our actions moving forward. 3.

			 of the loss of certain online resources (a) Study The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the  Secretary 47 U.S.C. 230(f) Public Law 115–164 (b) Interviews and surveys The study under subsection (a) shall include interviews with, and surveys conducted by, nonprofit and community-based organizations that provide direct services to people engaged in transactional sex. (c) Topics The study under subsection (a) shall include assessment of the following impacts on people engaged in transactional sex: (1) Changes in access to technology-related harm reduction services. (2) Changes in ability to negotiate terms with potential clients. (3) Changes in experiences of violence from clients. (4) Changes in interactions with law enforcement officials, including changes in police surveillance, stops, and arrests. (5) Changes in contact from third parties. (6) Changes in relationship to and reliance on third parties. (7) Changes in experiences of exploitation. (8) Impacts on access to economic resources. (9) Impacts on homelessness and housing stability. (10) Impacts on mental health. (11) Impacts on vulnerability to the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. (12) Changes in participation in other criminalized behavior. (13) Disparities in these effects on key populations typically underserved by service providers, specifically LGBTQI+ individuals, people living in rural areas, racial and ethnic minorities, Tribal communities, people experiencing exploitation and trafficking, and undocumented and documented foreign nationals. (14) Any other impacts on people engaged in transactional sex, as determined appropriate by the Secretary for inclusion in the study. (d) Report Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on the results of the study under subsection (a) and make such report available to the public."|N//A|N//A|N//A|N//A|N//A

"|II|116th CONGRESS|1st Session|S. 3061|IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES|A BILL|"To provide protection for survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault under the Fair Housing
			 Act."|" 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the  Fair Housing for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Survivors Act of 2019 2. Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) Cities, towns, and rural communities in the United States continue to face enormous challenges regarding domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other forms of intimate partner violence. (2) One in 3 women have experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. (3) Approximately 7,000,000 women are raped or physically assaulted by a current or former intimate partner each year. (4) Each day, an average of 3 women are killed by a current or former partner. (5) Researchers estimate that domestic violence costs employers up to $13,000,000,000 each year. (6) A fundamental component of ending domestic and sexual violence is securing safe and affordable housing for victims. (7) Research indicates that— (A) nearly 50 percent of all homeless women report that domestic violence was the immediate cause of their homelessness; (B) 92 percent of homeless women report having experienced severe physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives; (C) victims become homeless as a result of sexual assault, and once homeless, are vulnerable to further sexual victimization and exploitation; (D) women of color in the lowest income category experience 6 times the rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence compared to White women in the highest income category; (E) poor women of color, domestic violence victims, and women with children have a high risk of eviction; and (F) approximately 38 percent of all victims of domestic violence become homeless at some point in their life. (8) Surveys show that a majority of victims who experience a sexual assault in their home do not relocate to a safe environment because they do not have sufficient funds and are not aware of better options. (9) Domestic and sexual violence victims often find themselves trapped in homes where they are further victimized by caregivers, parents, siblings, landlords, intimate partners, neighbors, or others in or near their home. Economic insecurity and the trauma that often follows sexual assault make it difficult, if not impossible, for many victims to access safe, affordable housing options for themselves and their families. (10) Domestic and sexual violence victims continue to face discrimination in securing and maintaining housing based on their status as victims and as a result of crimes committed against them. (11) Research by the Attorney General of the State of New York found that 67 percent of domestic violence victims reported that discrimination by landlords is a significant obstacle in obtaining housing. (12) Research also shows that victims of domestic violence or sexual assault are commonly denied housing opportunities if a previous residence of the victim was a domestic violence shelter, if the victim has secured a protective order, or if there is other evidence that the victim has experienced a previous domestic violence incident. (13) Studies show that victims of domestic violence or sexual assault often face eviction based on a single domestic violence incident. (14) It is in the public interest to ensure that victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other forms of intimate partner violence are not discriminated against, particularly with respect to housing, based on their status as victims or the crimes committed against them. (15) Nothing in this Act should be interpreted to limit the ability of victims of domestic violence or sexual assault to recover for claims of discrimination on the basis of sex or race under the Fair Housing Act ( 42 U.S.C. 3601 3.

(6) Among the Asian and Pacific Islander population, the higher incidence rate of liver cancer is partially explained by higher incidence rates of hepatitis B and diabetes, which are comorbidities shown to increase an individual’s risk of developing liver cancer. (7) The most common causes of liver cancer include hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. (8) Hepatitis B is a primary risk factor for developing liver cancer, and 1 in 4 of those chronically infected with hepatitis B develop cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. (9) Half of all individuals with hepatitis B in the United States are Asian American or Pacific Islander, though this group accounts for only 5 percent of the population of the United States. (10) Among African immigrants in the United States, the prevalence of hepatitis B infection is approximately 1 in 10, and African immigrants make up 30 percent of those with chronic hepatitis B infection in the United States. (11) Among Hispanic/Latino communities, liver cancer incidence and death rates are twice as high compared to the non-Hispanic White population. (12) Hispanics/Latinos are 60 percent more likely to die from viral hepatitis than non-Hispanic Whites. 3.

Findings Congress finds the following: (1) General findings (A) Consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs 15 U.S.C. 1681 FCRA (B) In a December 2012 paper,  Key Dimensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Reporting System: A review for how the nation’s largest credit bureaus manage consumer data Consumer Bureau (C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing credit information to each of the nationwide CRAs account for more than half of all accounts reflected in consumers’ credit files. (D) Consumer reports play an increasingly important role in the lives of American consumers. Most creditors, for example, review these reports to make decisions about whether to extend credit to consumers and what terms and conditions to offer them. As such, information contained in these reports affects whether a person is able to get a private education loan to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, as well as the terms and conditions under which consumer credit products or services are offered to them. (E) Credit reports are also increasingly used for many noncredit decisions, including by landlords to determine whether to rent an apartment to a prospective tenant and by employers to decide whether to hire potential job applicants or to offer a promotion to existing employees. (F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to verify independently the accuracy and completeness of information included on the reports that they provide. (G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to establish and follow reasonable procedures, as required by existing law, to establish the maximum level of accuracy of information contained on consumer reports. Given the repeated failures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy requirements on their own, legislation is intended to provide them with detailed guidance improving the accuracy and completeness of information contained in consumer reports, including procedures, policies, and practices that these CRAs should already be following to ensure full compliance with their existing obligations. (H) The presence of inaccurate or incomplete information on these reports can result in substantial financial and emotional harm to consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to the loss of a new employment opportunity or a denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop someone from being able to access credit on favorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. (I) Current industry practices impose an unfair burden of proof on consumers trying to fix errors on their reports. (J) Consumer reports containing inaccurate or incomplete credit information also undermine the ability of creditors and lenders to effectively and accurately underwrite and price credit. (K) Recognizing that credit reporting affects the lives of almost all consumers in this country and that the consequences of errors on a consumer report can be catastrophic for a consumer, the Consumer Bureau began accepting consumer complaints about credit reporting in October 2012. (L) As of February 2017, the Consumer Bureau has handled approximately 185,717 credit reporting complaints, making credit reporting consistently the third most-complained-about subject matter on which the Consumer Bureau accepts consumer complaints. (M) In the  Monthly Complaint Report Volume 20 (N) Other common types of credit reporting complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau related to the improper use of a report, trouble obtaining a report or credit score, CRAs’ investigations, and credit monitoring or identity protection. (O) In the summer 2015  Supervisory Highlights (P) According to the fall 2016  Supervisory Highlights (Q) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau report titled  Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot (R) As evidence that the current system lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to develop more robust procedures to increase the accuracy and completeness of information on credit reports, litigation discovery documented by the National Consumer Law Center ( NCLC Automated Injustice: How a Mechanized Dispute System Frustrates Consumers Seeking to Fix Errors in Their Credit Reports (S) Unlike most other business relationships, where consumers can register their satisfaction or unhappiness with a particular credit product or service simply by taking their business elsewhere, consumers have no say in whether their information is included in the CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or poor service. (T) Accordingly, despite the existing statutory mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of the information whenever they prepare consumer reports, numerous studies, the high volume of consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau about incorrect information on consumer reports, and supervisory activities by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate that CRAs continue to skirt their obligations under the law. (2) Incorrect information on consumer reports (A) Consumers are entitled to dispute errors on their consumer reports with either the CRA, who issued the report, or directly with furnishers, who supplied the account information to the CRA, and request that mistakes be deleted or removed. Consumers, who believe an investigation has not correctly resolved their dispute, however, have few options, other than requesting that a statement about the dispute be included with their future reports. (B) CRAs have a statutory obligation under the FCRA to perform a reasonable investigation by conducting a substantive and searching inquiry when a consumer disputes an item on their report. In doing so, CRAs must conduct an independent review about the accuracy of any disputed item and cannot merely rely on a furnisher’s  rubber-stamp (C) The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC Report to Congress Under Section 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (D) Consumer Bureau examiners have identified repeated deficiencies with the nationwide CRAs’ information collection. In the summer 2015  Supervisory Highlights (E) In its  Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot (F) In the winter 2015  Supervisory Highlights (G) Consumer Bureau examiners also noted in the fall 2016  Supervisory Highlights (H) Consumers’ increasing frustration about the difficulties of trying to fix credit reporting errors, evidenced through the volume of consumer complaints related to errors submitted to the Consumer Bureau, are also echoed in another FTC study issued in January 2015. In the  Report to Congress under Section 319 for the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (I) The consistently high volume of consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau about credit reporting errors, coupled with the largest CRAs’ repeated quality control weaknesses found by Consumer Bureau examiners, show that the nationwide CRAs have failed to establish and follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum accuracy of information and to conduct independent investigations of consumers’ disputes. These ongoing problems demonstrate the need for legislation to— (i) enhance obligations on furnishers to substantiate information and require furnishers to keep records for the same amount of time that adverse information about these accounts may appear on a person’s consumer report; (ii) eliminate CRAs’ discretion to determine the relevancy of materials provided by consumers to support their dispute claims by instead requiring them to pass all material onto furnishers and eliminating CRA’s discretion to deem some disputes frivolous or irrelevant when a consumer resubmits a claim that they believe has been inadequately resolved; (iii) enhance educational content on CRAs’ websites to improve consumers’ understanding of the dispute process and to make it easier for all consumers to initiate claims, including by providing these disclosures in other languages besides English; and (iv) create a new consumer right to appeal reviews by CRAs and furnishers of the initial disputes. (3) Injunctive relief (A) Despite the fact that the FCRA currently provides implicit authority for injunctive relief, consumers have been prevented from exercising this right. Legislation explicitly clarifying this right is intended to underscore congressional intent that injunctive relief should be viewed as a remedy available to consumers. (B) Myriad findings by the courts, regulators, consumers, and consumer advocates make clear that CRAs have failed to establish adequate standards for the accuracy and completeness of consumer reports, yet the nationwide CRAs have demonstrated little willingness to voluntarily retool their policies and procedures to fix the problems. (C) Providing courts with explicit authority to issue injunctive relief, by telling the CRAs to remedy unlawful practices and procedures, would further CRAs’ mandate under the FCRA to assure the maximum possible accuracy and completeness of information contained on credit reports. (D) Absent explicit authority to issue injunctions, history suggests that the nationwide CRAs are likely to continue conducting business as usual in treating any monetary settlements with individual consumers and fines imposed by State attorneys general and Federal regulators, simply as the  cost of doing business (4) Deceptive and misleading marketing practices (A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 2015 report titled  Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and Scores (B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bureau fined TransUnion and Equifax for deceptively marketing credit scores for purchase by consumers as the same credit scores typically used by lenders to determine creditworthiness and for luring consumers into costly subscription services that were advertised as  free $1 (C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other nationwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 for deceiving consumers about the use of credit scores that it marketed and sold to consumers as credit scores that were used by lenders and for illegally advertising its products on web pages that consumers accessed through AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained their free annual disclosures. Experian was ordered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitution to harmed consumers and a civil monetary penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bureau. (D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and March 2017 consent orders with the three nationwide CRAs show that these CRAs have enticed consumers into purchasing products and services that they may not want or need, in some instances by advertising products or services  free (E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer reports in consumers’ lives and the fact that consumers’ participation in the credit reporting system is involuntary, CRAs should also prioritize providing consumers with the effective means to safeguard their personal and financial information and improve their credit standing, rather than seeking to exploit consumers’ concerns and confusion about credit reporting and scoring, to boost their companies’ profits. (F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legitimate concerns about the security of their personal and financial information, deserve clear, accurate, and transparent information about the credit reporting tools that may be available to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes. 3. Effective date The amendments made by this Act shall take effect 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. 4. Consumer Bureau rulemaking Except as otherwise provided, not later than the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall issue final rules to implement the amendments made by this Act.

Findings Congress finds the following: (1) General findings (A) Consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs 15 U.S.C. 1681 FCRA (B) In a December 2012 paper,  Key Dimensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Reporting System: A review for how the nation’s largest credit bureaus manage consumer data Consumer Bureau (C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing credit information to each of the nationwide CRAs account for more than half of all accounts reflected in consumers’ credit files. (D) Consumer reports play an increasingly important role in the lives of American consumers. Most creditors, for example, review these reports to make decisions about whether to extend credit to consumers and what terms and conditions to offer them. As such, information contained in these reports affects whether a person is able to get a private education loan to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, as well as the terms and conditions under which consumer credit products or services are offered to them. (E) Credit reports are also increasingly used for many noncredit decisions, including by landlords to determine whether to rent an apartment to a prospective tenant and by employers to decide whether to hire potential job applicants or to offer a promotion to existing employees. (F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to verify independently the accuracy and completeness of information included on the reports that they provide. (G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to establish and follow reasonable procedures, as required by existing law, to establish the maximum level of accuracy of information contained on consumer reports. Given the repeated failures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy requirements on their own, legislation is intended to provide them with detailed guidance improving the accuracy and completeness of information contained in consumer reports, including procedures, policies, and practices that these CRAs should already be following to ensure full compliance with their existing obligations. (H) The presence of inaccurate or incomplete information on these reports can result in substantial financial and emotional harm to consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to the loss of a new employment opportunity or a denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop someone from being able to access credit on favorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. (I) Current industry practices impose an unfair burden of proof on consumers trying to fix errors on their reports. (J) Consumer reports containing inaccurate or incomplete credit information also undermine the ability of creditors and lenders to effectively and accurately underwrite and price credit. (K) Recognizing that credit reporting affects the lives of almost all consumers in this country and that the consequences of errors on a consumer report can be catastrophic for a consumer, the Consumer Bureau began accepting consumer complaints about credit reporting in October 2012. (L) As of February 2017, the Consumer Bureau has handled approximately 185,717 credit reporting complaints, making credit reporting consistently the third most-complained-about subject matter on which the Consumer Bureau accepts consumer complaints. (M) In the  Monthly Complaint Report Volume 20 (N) Other common types of credit reporting complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau related to the improper use of a report, trouble obtaining a report or credit score, CRAs’ investigations, and credit monitoring or identity protection. (O) In the summer 2015  Supervisory Highlights (P) According to the fall 2016  Supervisory Highlights (Q) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau report titled  Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot (R) As evidence that the current system lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to develop more robust procedures to increase the accuracy and completeness of information on credit reports, litigation discovery documented by the National Consumer Law Center ( NCLC Automated Injustice: How a Mechanized Dispute System Frustrates Consumers Seeking to Fix Errors in Their Credit Reports (S) Unlike most other business relationships, where consumers can register their satisfaction or unhappiness with a particular credit product or service simply by taking their business elsewhere, consumers have no say in whether their information is included in the CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or poor service. (T) Accordingly, despite the existing statutory mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of the information whenever they prepare consumer reports, numerous studies, the high volume of consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau about incorrect information on consumer reports, and supervisory activities by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate that CRAs continue to skirt their obligations under the law. (2) Private education loans (A) The Consumer Bureau’s October 2014 report titled  Annual Report of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman (B) Although private student loan holders may allow a borrower to postpone payments while enrolled in school full-time, many limit this option to a certain time period, usually 48 to 66 months. This limited time period may not be sufficient for those who need additional time to obtain their degree or who want to continue their education by pursing a graduate or professional degree. The Consumer Bureau found that borrowers who were unable to make payments often defaulted or had their accounts sent to collections before they were even able to graduate. (3) Deceptive practices at certain proprietary education institutions and career education programs (A) NCLC cited the proliferation of law enforcement actions against many for-profit schools in its June 2014 report, titled  Ensuring Educational Integrity: 10 Steps to Improve State Oversight of For-profit Schools (B) The closure and bankruptcy of Corinthian Colleges, which was found to have deceived students by steering them into high-interest student loans based on misleading graduation rates and employment data, is a good example of the problem. Even after its closure, many Corinthian students remained saddled with student loan debt, worthless degrees, and few prospects for employment. (C) Attending a two-year, for-profit college costs, on average, four times as much as attending a community college. Students at for-profit colleges represent only about 11 percent of the total higher education population but a startling 44 percent of all Federal student loan defaults, according to the United States Department of Education ( DOE (D) According to NCLC, a disproportionate number of for-profit students are low-income and people of color. These schools target veterans, working parents, first-generation students, and non-English speaking students, who may be more likely than their public or private nonprofit school counterparts to drop out, incur enormous student debt, and default on this debt. In the 2011–2012 school year, 28 percent of African Americans and 15 percent of Latinos attending four-year institutions were enrolled in a for-profit school, compared to 10 percent of Whites. (E) As highlighted in a press release titled  Obama Administration Announces Final Rules to Protect Students from Poor-Performing Career College Programs t (4) Medical debt (A) Research by the Consumer Bureau has found that the inclusion of medical collections on consumer reports has unfairly reduced consumers’ credit scores. (B) The Consumer Bureau’s review of 5 million anonymized credit files from September 2011 to September 2013, for example, found that credit scores may underestimate a person’s creditworthiness by up to 10 points for those who owe medical debt, and may underestimate a person’s creditworthiness by up to 22 points after the medical debt has been paid. For consumers with lower credit scores, especially those on the brink of what is considered subprime, a 10 to 22 point decrease in their credit scores can have a significant impact on their lives, including by affecting whether they are able to qualify for credit and, if so, the terms and conditions under which it is extended to them. (C) The Consumer Bureau found that half of all collections trade lines that appear on consumer reports are related to medical bills claimed to be owed to hospitals and other medical providers. These trade lines affect the reports of nearly 1⁄5 of all consumers in the credit reporting system. (D) The Consumer Bureau has found that there are no objective or enforceable standards that determine when a debt can or should be reported as a collection trade line. Because debt buyers and collectors determine whether, when, and for how long to report a collection account, there is only a limited relationship between the time period reported, the severity of a delinquency, and when or whether a collection trade line appears on a consumer’s credit report. (E) Medical bills can be complex and confusing for many consumers, which results in consumers’ uncertainty about what they owe, to whom, when, or for what, that may cause some people, who ordinarily pay their bills on time, to delay or withhold payments on their medical debts. This uncertainty can also result in medical collections appearing on consumer reports. In a December 2014 report titled  Consumer Credit Reports: A Study of Medical and Non-Medical Collections (F) The Consumer Bureau concluded that the presence of medical collections is less predictive of future defaults or serious delinquencies than the presence of a nonmedical collection in a study titled  Data Point: Medical Debt and Credit Scores (G) FICO’s latest credit scoring model,  FICO 9 (H) VantageScore’s latest credit scoring model,  VantageScore 4.0 (I) The three nationwide CRAs entered into a settlement agreement with the New York State attorney general in 2015 to address deficiencies in their dispute resolution process and enhance the accuracy of items on reports. These policy changes will be implemented in a three-phrased rollout, culminating by June 2018. Subsequently, these CRAs entered into a cooperative agreement with 31 State Attorneys General, which was the basis of the creation of the National Consumer Assistance Plan ( NCAP (J) While the CRAs appear to be voluntarily adopting policy changes on a nationwide basis, they are not obligated to do so for consumers who reside in States that are not party to any of the consent orders. (K) As a result of the settlement agreements, the three nationwide CRAs will set a 180-day waiting period before including medical collections on a report and will remove a medical collection from a report once it is paid by an insurance company. While this change will benefit many, once a medical collection appears on a report, it will only be deleted or suppressed if it is found to have been the insurance company’s obligation to pay and the insurer pays it. Given the research showing there is little predictive value in medical debt information, medical collections that are paid or settled should quickly be removed from a report, regardless of who pays or settles this debt. (5) Financial abuse by known persons (A) Financial abuse and exploitation are frequently associated with domestic violence. This type of abuse may result in fraudulent charges to a credit card or having fraudulent accounts created by the abuser in the survivor’s name. Financial abuse may also result in the survivor’s inability to make timely payments on their valid obligations due to loss or changes in income that can occur when their abuser steals from or coerces the survivor to relinquish their paychecks or savings. (B) By racking up substantial debts in the survivor’s name, abusers are able to exercise financial control over their survivors to make it economically difficult for the survivor, whose credit is often destroyed, to escape the situation. (C) Domestic abuse survivors with poor credit are likely to face significant obstacles in establishing financial independence from their abusers. This can be due, in part, because consumer reports may be used when a person attempts to obtain a checking account, housing, insurance, utilities, employment, and even a security clearance as required for certain jobs. (D) Providing documentation of identity ( ID (E) While it is easier for consumers who obtain a police report to remove fraudulent information from their consumer report and prevent it from reappearing in the future, according to the Empire Justice Center, safety and other noncredit concerns may impact the capacity of a survivor of financial abuse committed by a known person to turn to law enforcement to get a police report. (F) According to the Legal Aid Society in New York, domestic abuse survivors, seeking to remove adverse information stemming from financial abuse by contacting their furnishers directly, are likely to face skepticism about claims of ID theft perpetrated by a partner because of an assumption that they are aware of, and may have been complicit in, the activity which the survivor alleges stems from financial abuse. (6) Deceptive and misleading marketing practices (A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 2015 report titled  Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and Scores (B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bureau fined TransUnion and Equifax for deceptively marketing credit scores for purchase by consumers as the same credit scores typically used by lenders to determine creditworthiness and for luring consumers into costly subscription services that were advertised as  free $1 (C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other nationwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 for deceiving consumers about the use of credit scores that it marketed and sold to consumers as credit scores that were used by lenders and for illegally advertising its products on web pages that consumers accessed through AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained their free annual disclosures. Experian was ordered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitution to harmed consumers and a civil monetary penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bureau. (D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and March 2017 consent orders with the three nationwide CRAs show that these CRAs have enticed consumers into purchasing products and services that they may not want or need, in some instances by advertising products or services  free (E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer reports in consumers’ lives and the fact that consumers’ participation in the credit reporting system is involuntary, CRAs should also prioritize providing consumers with the effective means to safeguard their personal and financial information and improve their credit standing, rather than seeking to exploit consumers’ concerns and confusion about credit reporting and scoring, to boost their companies’ profits. (F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legitimate concerns about the security of their personal and financial information, deserve clear, accurate, and transparent information about the credit reporting tools that may be available to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes. (7) Protections for consumers’ credit information (A) Despite heightened awareness, incidents of ID theft continue to rise. In February 2015, the FTC reported that ID theft was the top consumer complaint that it received for the 15th consecutive year. As these incidents increase, consumers experience significant financial loss and emotional distress from the inability to safeguard effectively and inexpensively their credit information from bad actors. (B) According to a Carnegie Mellon study, children are 50 times more likely than adults to have their identities stolen. Child identities are valuable to thieves because most children do not have existing files, and their parents may not notice fraudulent activity until their child applies for a student loan, a job, or a credit card. As a result, the fraudulent activity of the bad actors may go undetected for years. (C) Despite the increasing incidents of children’s ID theft, parents who want to proactively prevent their children from having their identity stolen, may not be able to do so. Only one of the three nationwide CRAs currently allows parents from any State to set up a freeze for a minor child. At the other two nationwide CRAs, parents can only obtain a freeze after a child has become an ID theft victim because, it is only at this point, that these CRAs have an existing credit file for the child. While many States have enacted laws to address this problem, there is no existing Federal law. (D) According to Javelin Strategy & Research’s 2015 Identity Fraud study, $16 billion was stolen by fraudsters from 12.7 million American consumers in 2014. Similarly, the United States Department of Justice found an estimated 7 percent of all residents age 16 or older (about 17.6 million persons) in this country were victims of one or more incidents of ID theft in 2014, and the number of elderly victims age 65 or older (about 86 percent) increased from 2.1 million in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2014. (E) Consumers frequently express concern about the security of their financial information. According to a 2015 MasterCard survey, a majority of consumers (77 percent) have anxiety about the possibility that their financial information and Social Security numbers may be stolen or compromised, with about 55 percent of consumers indicating that they would rather have naked pictures of themselves leaked online than have their financial information stolen. (F) That survey also revealed that consumers’ fears about the online security of their financial information even outweighed consumers’ worries about other physical security dangers such as having their houses robbed (59 percent) or being pickpocketed (46 percent). (G) According to Consumer Reports, roughly 50 million American consumers spent about $3.5 billion in 2010 to purchase products aimed at protecting their identity, with the annual cost of these services ranging from $120 to $300. As risks to consumers’ personal and financial information continue to grow, consumers need additional protections to ensure that they have fair and reasonable access to the full suite of ID theft and fraud prevention measures that may be right for them. 3.

(3) Although the Veterans Health Administration requires all health care providers to be credentialed by personnel of the Administration prior to providing care to veterans, the Report revealed disturbing lapses and inconsistencies in adherence to that policy due in part to a lack of mandatory training for credentialing personnel. (4) In addition to endangering the care of veterans at facilities of the Veterans Health Administration, the hiring of health care providers who lack proper credentials wastes time and financial resources of the Administration. (b) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that— (1) without the implementation of uniform policies for credentialing health care providers and a periodic review of all provider credentials, the Veterans Health Administration will continue to hire or retain providers who lack proper credentials to the detriment of patients seeking the services of the Administration; and (2) the Veterans Health Administration must act swiftly to ensure that— (A) all health care providers are properly credentialed; (B) all credentialing personnel are properly trained to identify adverse actions in the history of a provider that are disqualifying; and (C) all Veterans Integrated Service Networks, and the facilities that comprise those networks, are able to communicate credentialing information to other networks or facilities to avoid hiring health care providers who lack proper credentials. 3. Improvement of provider credentialing practices of the Department of Veterans Affairs through
			 training and transparency (a) In general Section 7402 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: 
  (h) (1) The Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe regulations, administrative guidance, and management controls applicable to the credentialing of persons appointed to a position under this section and, to the maximum extent feasible, provide advice, assistance, and guidance to personnel of the Administration to improve the credentialing process and ensure that all persons appointed to such a position meet the qualifications for that position. (2) (A) The Under Secretary for Health shall require that all personnel of the Administration who verify credentials for persons appointed under this section, review qualifications for such persons, or hire such persons periodically undergo training to review relevant law and policy regarding provider qualifications for employment with the Administration. (B) Training required under subparagraph (A) for personnel described in that subparagraph shall include— (i) the establishment of uniform credentialing standards and protocols for all facilities of the Administration; (ii) training on laws and regulations relating to health care providers in the area in which the personnel are located and how those laws and regulations should be considered in the credentialing process; and (iii) any other information that the Under Secretary for Health considers relevant to include for the benefit of the personnel or those served by the Administration. (C) All newly hired personnel described in subparagraph (A) shall complete training under this paragraph before being allowed to verify credentials for persons appointed under this section, review qualifications for such persons, or hire such persons. (D) The Under Secretary for Health shall review and update training under this paragraph according to changes in law, guidance issued by the Under Secretary, or any other circumstance that affects the content of the training. (3) The Under Secretary for Health— (A) shall enroll all persons appointed under this section in continuous query of their record within the National Practitioner Data Bank; and (B) shall develop and implement a mechanism for monitoring the continuous query described in subparagraph (A) and updating credential information of persons appointed under this section within the VetPro System, or successor system, to facilitate the sharing of credential information between Veterans Integrated Service Networks and facilities of the Administration. (4) (A) Not less frequently than annually, the Under Secretary for Health shall submit to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives an audit of all persons employed by the Administration pursuant to an appointment described in this section who have an adverse action reported on the National Practitioner Data Bank. (B) The audit required under subparagraph (A) shall include for each person covered by the audit the following: (i) The Veterans Integrated Service Network and State where the person works or worked. (ii) The occupation of the person. (iii) The date the person was hired and the date of removal or resignation of the person, if applicable. (iv) A brief summary of the report provided by the National Practitioner Data Bank describing the lack of qualifications, disciplinary actions, or adverse findings with respect to the person that impact the ability of the person to perform the duties of the position to which the person was appointed under this section. (v) The response of the Under Secretary for Health to the report under clause (iv) regarding the eligibility of the person to continue employment at the Administration, including a brief explanation or citation of relevant policy of the Administration used in making such response. (C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the disclosure of information that is otherwise protected from mandatory disclosure by law. . (b) Effective date The amendment made by this section shall take effect 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act."|N//A|N//A|N//A|N//A|N//A

Findings; sense of Congress; purposes (a) Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United States are foundational to the economy, security, global competitiveness, and well-being of the United States and continuously serve the people of the United States and other countries as an important source of food, energy, economic productivity, recreation, beauty, and enjoyment. (2) Over many years, the resource productivity and water quality of the ocean and coastal areas of the United States have been diminished by pollution, increasing population demands, economic development, and natural and man-made hazard events, both acute and chronic. (3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United States are managed by State and Federal resource agencies and regulated on an interstate and regional scale by various overlapping Federal authorities, thereby creating a significant need for interstate coordination to enhance regional priorities, including the ecological and economic health of those areas. (b) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States should seek to support interstate coordination of shared regional priorities relating to the management, conservation, resilience, and restoration of ocean and coastal areas to maximize efficiencies through collaborative regional efforts by Regional Ocean Partnerships, in consultation with Federal and State agencies, Tribal governments, and local authorities; and (2) such efforts would enhance existing and effective State coastal management efforts based on shared regional priorities. (c) Purposes The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To complement and expand cooperative voluntary efforts intended to manage and restore ocean and coastal areas spanning across multiple State boundaries. (2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, data management, and restoration activities in ocean and coastal areas. (3) To commit the United States to a comprehensive cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and improvements in the productivity of living resources of, all coastal ecosystems. (4) To authorize Regional Ocean Partnerships as intergovernmental coordinators for shared interstate and regional priorities relating to the collaborative management of the large marine ecosystems, thereby reducing duplication of efforts and maximizing opportunities to leverage support in the ocean and coastal regions. (5) To enable Regional Ocean Partnerships, or designated fiscal management entities of such partnerships, to receive Federal funding to conduct the scientific research, conservation and restoration activities, and priority coordination on shared regional priorities necessary to achieve the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4). 3.
